# 2048_Game

2048 is an classical mobile game, and this is my personal game demo.



## Game rules

The rules of the game are very simple. You need to control all the squares to move in the same direction. Two squares of the same number collide and merge into their sum. After each operation, a 2 or 4 is randomly generated, and finally a "2048" is obtained. 

**Try to get higher score!**
